This work is about using robotic motion planning to study protein-ligand binding in the applied field of computational or virtual drug screening for the drug discovery process.

[See conference program here](https://d10k7k7mywg42z.cloudfront.net/assets/55f88241edb2f3350804f7ec/Tapia_2015_Final_Program_.pdf)

I carried out this research in summer of 2014 when I was privileged to participate in the Distributed Research Experiences for Undergraduates (DREU).
